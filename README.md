tagteam-mobile
==============
GSoC project by Yevhenii Vlasenko, mentored by Daniel Collis-Puro

Objective: build jQuery mobile client for TagTeam.
Result: working jQuery web application, working mobile app compiled through PhoneGap

Plan of development:
1. Building UI on jQuery.
  Pages:
    index, hub, items, currentItem, about, search, options, searchResults, inputs, bookmarks, remixes, tags, filters, updates.

2. Writing AJAX data requests. Connecting recieved data with UI.

3. Adding some features.
  On this step we already have working project which we start to improve. Auto-update feature and saving to localstorage will be added for sure.
  If there will be some more ideas - they will be implemented.
